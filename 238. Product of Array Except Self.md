# 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array `nums`, return _an array_ `answer` _such that_ `answer[i]` _is equal to the product of all the elements of_ `nums` _except_ `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a __32-bit__ integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

__Constraints__:
* `2 <= nums.length <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
* `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
* The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is __guaranteed__ to fit in a __32-bit__ integer.

__Follow up__: Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array __does not__ count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

__Python__:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        output = [1] * n
        left_product, right_product = 1, 1
        for i in range(n):
            output[i] *= left_product
            left_product *= nums[i]
            output[n - 1 - i] *= right_product
            right_product *= nums[n - 1 - i]
        return output
```
