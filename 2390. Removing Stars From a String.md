# 2390. Removing Stars From a String

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:

* Choose a star in `s`.
* Remove the closest __non-star__ character to its __left__, as well as remove the star itself.

Return _the string after __all__ stars have been removed_.

__Note__:
* The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
* It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
```

__Constraints__:
* `1 <= s.length <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
* The operation above can be performed on `s`.

__Python__:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for c in s:
            if c == '*':
                if stack: stack.pop()
            else: stack.append(c)
        return ''.join(stack)
```
