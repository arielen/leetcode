# 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (__0-indexed__). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. __Note that__ `pos` __is not passed as a parameter__.

__Do not modify__ the linked list.

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

__Constraints__:
* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10`<sup>`4`</sup>`]`.
* `-10`<sup>`5`</sup>` <= Node.val <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
* `pos` is `-1` or a __valid index__ in the linked-list.
 

__Follow up__: Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

__Python__:
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None


class Solution(object):
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
            if slow == fast: break

        if not fast or not fast.next: return None

        slow = head
        while slow != fast: slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next
        return slow
```
