# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string_.

Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```
Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```
Example 3:
```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```

__Constraints__:
* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

__Python__:
```python

    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        merged = [word1[i] + word2[i]
                  for i in range(min(len(word1), len(word2)))]
        merged += word1[len(word2)
                            :] if len(word1) > len(word2) else word2[len(word1):]
        return ''.join(merged)


class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        s1 = 0
        s2 = 0
        res = ""
        while s1 < len(word1) and s2 < len(word2):
            res += word1[s1] + word2[s2]
            s1 += 1
            s2 += 1
        res += word1[s1:]
        res += word2[s1:]
        return (res)
