# 206. Reverse Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

__Constraints__:
* The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
* `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

__Follow up__: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?


__Python__:
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        prev, curr = None, head
        while curr:
            next = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next
        return prev
```
