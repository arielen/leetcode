# 409. Longest Palindrome

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the _length of the __longest palindrome___ that can be built with those letters.

Letters are __case sensitive__, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```

__Constraints__:
* `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
* `s` consists of lowercase __and/or__ uppercase English letters only.


__Python__:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        d = {}
        for c in s: d[c] = d.get(c, 0) + 1
        ans = 0
        for v in d.values():
            ans += v // 2 * 2
            if ans % 2 == 0 and v % 2 == 1: ans += 1
        return ans
```
