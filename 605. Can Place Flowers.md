# 605. Can Place Flowers

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in __adjacent__ plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _new flowers can be planted in the_ `flowerbed` _without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and_ `false` _otherwise_.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

__Constraints__:
* `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10`<sup>`4`</sup>
* `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
* There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
* `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

__Python__:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed, n):
        """
        :type flowerbed: List[int]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        i = 0
        while i < len(flowerbed) and n > 0:
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i-1] == 0) and (i == len(flowerbed)-1 or flowerbed[i+1] == 0):
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                n -= 1
            i += 1
        return not n
```
