# 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in __non-decreasing order__, and a character `target`. There are __at least two different__ characters in `letters`.

Return _the smallest character in_ `letters` _that is lexicographically greater than_ `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

Example 1:
```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
```

__Constraints__:
* `2 <= letters.length <= 10`<sup>`4`</sup>
* `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
* `letters` is sorted in __non-decreasing__ order.
* `letters` contains at least two different characters.
* `target` is a lowercase English letter.


__Python__:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters, target):
        """
        :type letters: List[str]
        :type target: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        for i in range(len(letters)):
            if letters[i] > target:
                return letters[i]
        return letters[0]

class Solution(object):
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters, target):
        """
        :type letters: List[str]
        :type target: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        index = bisect.bisect(letters, target)
        return letters[index % len(letters)]
