# 443. String Compression

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
* If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
* Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` __should not be returned separately__, but instead, be stored __in the input character array__ `chars`. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done __modifying the input array__, return _the new length of the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:
```
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
```

__Constraints__:
* `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
* `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

__Python__:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def compress(self, chars):
        """
        :type chars: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        cnt = 1
        j = 0
        for i in range(1, len(chars)+1):
            if i < len(chars) and chars[i] == chars[i-1]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                chars[j] = chars[i-1]
                j += 1
                if cnt > 1:
                    for ch in str(cnt):
                        chars[j] = ch
                        j += 1
                cnt = 1
        return j
```
