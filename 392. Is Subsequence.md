# 392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `s` _is a __subsequence__ of_ `t`, _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

A __subsequence__ of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

__Constraints__:
* `0 <= s.length <= 100`
* `0 <= t.length <= 10`<sup>`4`</sup>
* `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
 
__Follow up__: Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s`<sub>`1`</sub>, `s`<sub>`2`</sub>, `...`, `s`<sub>`k`</sub> where `k >= 10`<sup>`9`</sup>, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?


__Python__:
```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) == 0: return True
        if len(t) == 0: return False
        if s[0] == t[0]: return self.isSubsequence(s[1:], t[1:])
        else: return self.isSubsequence(s, t[1:])
        

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sub = ""
        for i in range(len(t)):
            if t[i] in s and t[i] == s[len(sub)]: sub += t[i]
            if len(sub) == len(s): break
        return sub == s
```
