# 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a string `s`, find _the longest palindromic __subsequence__'s length in_ `s`.

A __subsequence__ is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

__Constraints__:
* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

__Python__:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[i][i] = 1
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        return dp[0][n - 1]
```
